The Crystal Game
In this game you will be testing your memory and math skill at the same time!
You will be presented with a random number and with that number you must match it with Your Number.
To match the number you will get four crystals, each one of these crystals will have a different number value. With that you will need to do some math and add your crystals together to match the number.
Have Fun and Enjoy!
